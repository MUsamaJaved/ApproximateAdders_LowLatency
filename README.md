# Low Latency Approximate Adders

We provide MATLAB and Verilog Models of GeAr, and previously proposed adders (ACA-I, ETAII, ACA-II and GDA).

GeAr is a low latency Generic Accuracy Configurable Adder that provides a higher number of potential configurations compared to state-of-the-art approximate adders, thus enabling a high degree of flexibility and trade-off between performance and output quality.
These MATALB and Verilog models can allow software programmer as well as hardware designers to evaluate their code and design. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first open-source library of approximate adders that facilitates reproducible comparisons and further research and development in this direction across various layers of design abstraction.
